# Garage News AI

## Project Description

Garage News AI is an innovative Telegram bot project designed to automate the process of fetching, summarizing, and presenting trending technology news on Instagram. This bot project is primarily focused on educating ISEP students about the latest developments in AI, blockchain, VR/AR, cybersecurity, electronics, and programming.

This bot, once a week, uses the **NewsCatcher API** to fetch the latest tech news articles from reliable sources. The articles are then summarized into short, easy-to-understand contents tailored for an Instagram audience. To enhance the visual appeal, the bot uses AI technology to generate relevant images based on the summarized content.

The final outcome is six 1080x1080 Instagram-ready posts each week. Each post combines engaging content with an AI-generated image, providing a visually appealing and informative snapshot of the latest technology trends.
